      <p>NED KNOWLES.</p>
      <p>The baron ritzner von jung was a noble Hungarian family, every member of which
         (at least as far back into antiquity as any certain records extend) was more or 
         less remarkable for talent of some descriptionthe majority for that species 
         of grotesquerie in conception of which Tieck, a scion of the house, has given a vivid,
          although by no means the most vivid exemplifications. My acquaintance with Ritzner 
          commenced at the magnificent Chateau Jung, into which a train of droll adventures, not 
          to be made public, threw a place in his regard, and here, with somewhat more difficulty, 
          a partial insight into his mental conformation. In later days this insight grew more clear, 
          as the intimacy which had at first permitted it became more close; and when, after three years of the 
          character of the Baron Ritzner von Jung.</p>
          <p>I remember the buzz of curiosity which his advent excited 
            within the college precincts on the night of the twenty-fifth of June. I remember still more distinctly,
             that while he was pronounced by all parties at first sight "the most remarkable man in the world," 
             no person made any attempt at accounting for his opinion. That he was unique appeared so undeniable, that
              it was deemed impertinent to inquire wherein the uniquity consisted. But, letting this matter pass for 
              the present, I will merely observe that, from the first moment of his setting foot within the limits of 
              the university, he began to exercise over the habits, manners, persons, purses, and propensities of the 
              whole community which surrounded him, an influence the most extensive and despotic, yet at the same time
               the most indefinite and altogether unaccountable. Thus the brief period of his residence at the 
               university forms an era in its annals, and is characterized by all classes of people appertaining to it 
               or its dependencies as "that very extraordinary epoch forming the domination of the Baron Ritzner von 
               Jung." then of no particular age, by which I mean that it was impossible to form a guess respecting his 
               age by any data personally afforded. He might have been fifteen or fifty, and was twenty-one years and 
               seven months. He was by no means a handsome man perhaps the reverse. The contour of his face was
                somewhat angular and harsh. His forehead was lofty and very fair; his nose a snub; his eyes large, 
                heavy, glassy, and meaningless. About the mouth there was more to be observed. The lips were gently 
                protruded, and rested the one upon the other, after such a fashion that it is impossible to conceive 
                any, even the most complex, combination of human features, conveying so entirely, and so singly, the 
                idea of unmitigated gravity, solemnity and repose.</p><p>It will be perceived, no doubt, from what I
                   have already said, that the Baron was one of those human anomalies now and then to be found, who 
                   make the science of mystification the study and the business of their lives. For this science a
                    peculiar turn of mind gave him instinctively the cue, while his physical appearance afforded him 
                    unusual facilities for carrying his prospects into effect. I quaintly termed the domination of the
                     Baron Ritzner von Jung, ever rightly entered into the mystery which overshadowed his character. 
                     I truly think that no person at the university, with the exception of myself, ever suspected him 
                     to be capable of a joke, verbal or practical:the old bull-dog at the garden-gate would 
                     sooner have been accused,the ghost of Heraclitus,or the wig of the Emeritus Professor 
                     of Theology. This, too, when it was evident that the most egregious and unpardonable of all conceivable
                      tricks, whimsicalities and buffooneries were brought about, if not directly by him, at least plainly 
                      through his intermediate agency or connivance. The beauty, if I may so call it, of his art mystifique,
                       lay in that consummate ability (resulting from an almost intuitive knowledge of human nature, and a 
                       most wonderful self-possession,) by means of which he never failed to make it appear that the drolleries
                        he was occupied in bringing to a point, arose partly in spite, and partly in consequence of the laudable 
                        efforts he was making for their prevention, and for the preservation of the good order and dignity of
                         Alma Mater. The deep, the poignant, the overwhelming mortification, which upon each such failure of his
                          praise worthy endeavors, would suffuse every lineament of his countenance, left not the slightest room
                           for doubt of his sincerity in the bosoms of even his most skeptical companions. The adroitness, too, was 
                           no less worthy of observation by which he contrived to shift the sense of the grotesque from the creator
                            to the createdfrom his own person to the absurdities to which he had given rise. In no instance before 
                            that of which I speak, have I known the habitual mystific escape the natural consequence of his manoevres
                          an attachment of the ludicrous to his own character and person. Continually enveloped in an atmosphere of whim,
                           my friend appeared to live only for the severities of society; and not even his own household have for a moment
                            associated other ideas than those of the rigid and august with the memory of the Baron Ritzner von Jung. the demon
                             of the dolce far niente lay like an incubus upon the university. Nothing, at least, was done beyond eating 
                             and drinking and making merry. The apartments of the students were converted into so many pot-houses, and
                              there was no pot-house of them all more famous or more frequented than that of the Baron. Our carousals 
                              here were many, and boisterous, and long, and never unfruitful of events.</p>
                              <p>Upon one occasion we had 
                                protracted our sitting until nearly daybreak, and an unusual quantity of wine had been drunk. The company 
                                consisted of seven or eight individuals besides the Baron and myself. Most of these were young men of wealth, 
                                of high connection, of great family pride, and all alive with an exaggerated sense of honor. They abounded 
                                in the most ultra German opinions respecting the duello. To these Quixotic notions some recent Parisian 
                                publications, backed by three or four desperate and fatal conversation, during the greater part of the night, 
                                had run wild upon the all engrossing topic of the times. The Baron, who had been unusually silent and 
                                abstracted in the earlier portion of the evening, at length seemed to be aroused from his apathy, took a 
                                leading part in the discourse, and dwelt upon the benefits, and more especially upon the beauties, of the
                                 received code of etiquette in passages of arms with an ardor, an eloquence, an impressiveness, and an 
                                 affectionateness of manner, which elicited the warmest enthusiasm from his hearers in general, and absolutely
                                  staggered even myself, who well knew him to be at heart a ridiculer of those very points for which he 
                                  contended, and especially to hold the entire fanfaronade of duelling etiquette in the sovereign contempt 
                                  which it deserves.</p>
                                  <p>Looking around me during a pause in the Baron's discourse (of which my readers may 
                                    gather some faint idea when I say that it bore resemblance to the fervid, chanting, monotonous, yet musical 
                                    sermonic manner of Coleridge), I perceived symptoms of even more than the general interest in the countenance
                                     of one of the party. This gentleman, whom I shall call Hermann, was an original in every respect
                                     except, perhaps, in the single particular that he was a very great fool. He contrived to bear, however,
                                      among a particular set at the university, a reputation for deep metaphysical thinking, and, I believe, for
                                       some logical talent. As a duellist he had acquired who had fAllan at his hands; but they were many. He was a 
                                       man of courage undoubtedly. But it was upon his minute acquaintance with the etiquette of the duello, and 
                                       the nicety of his sense of honor, that he most especially prided himself. These things were a hobby which he 
                                       rode to the death. To Ritzner, ever upon the lookout for the grotesque, his peculiarities had for a long time
                                        past afforded food for mystification. Of this, however, I was not aware; although, in the present instance,
                                         I saw clearly that something of a whimsical nature was upon the tapis with my friend, and that Hermann was
                                          its especial object.</p>
                                <p>As the former proceeded in his discourse, or rather monologue I perceived the 
                                            excitement of the latter momently increasing. At length he spoke; offering some objection to a point 
                                            insisted upon by R., and giving his reasons in detail. To these the Baron replied at length (still
                                             maintaining his exaggerated tone of sentiment) and concluding, in what I thought very bad taste, 
                                             with a sarcasm and a sneer. The hobby of Hermann now took the bit in his teeth. This I could discern 
                                             by the studied hair-splitting farrago of his rejoinder. His last words I distinctly remember.
                                              "Your opinions, allow me to say, Baron von Jung, although in the main correct, are, in many nice 
                                              points, discreditable to yourself and to the university of which you are a member. In a few respects
                                               they are even unworthy of serious refutation. I would say more than this, sir, were it not for the
                                                fear of giving you offence (here the speaker smiled blandly), I would say, sir, that your opinions
                                                 are not the opinions to be expected from a gentleman."</p>
                              <p>As Hermann completed this equivocal sentence, all eyes were turned upon the Baron. He became pale, then 
                                excessively red; then, dropping his pocket-handkerchief, stooped to recover it, when I caught a glimpse of his 
                                countenance, while it could be seen by no one else at the table. It was radiant with the quizzical expression 
                                which was its natural character, but which I had never seen it assume except when we were alone together, and 
                                when he unbent himself freely. In an instant afterward he stood erect, confronting Hermann; and so total an 
                                alteration of countenance in so short a period I certainly never saw before. For a moment I even fancied that 
                                I had misconceived him, and that he was in sober earnest. He appeared to be stifling with passion, and his face 
                                was cadaverously white. For a short time he remained silent, apparently striving to master his emotion. Having 
                                at length seemingly succeeded, he reached a decanter which stood near him, saying as he held it firmly clenched 
                                "The language you have thought proper to employ, Mynheer Hermann, in addressing yourself to me, is objectionable
                                 in so many particulars, that I have neither temper nor time for specification. That my opinions, however, are not 
                                 the opinions to be expected from a gentleman, is an observation so directly offensive as to allow me but one line 
                                 of conduct. Some courtesy, nevertheless, is due to the presence of this company, and to yourself, at this moment,
                                  as my guest. You will pardon me, therefore, if, upon this consideration, I deviate slightly from the general usage
                                   among gentlemen in similar cases of personal affront. You will forgive me for the moderate tax I shall make upon 
                                   your imagination, and endeavor to consider, for an instant, the reflection of your person in yonder mirror as the
                                    living Mynheer Hermann himself. This being done, there will be no difficulty whatever. I shall discharge this 
                                    decanter of wine at your image in yonder mirror, and thus fulfil all the spirit, if not the exact letter, of 
                                    resentment for your insult, while the necessity of physical violence to your real person will be obviated."</p>
                    <p>With these words he hurled the decanter, full of wine, against the mirror which hung directly opposite Hermann; striking the
                      reflection of his person with great precision, and of course shattering the glass into fragments. The whole company 
                      at once started to their feet, and, with the exception of myself and Ritzner, took their departure. As Hermann went 
                      out, the Baron whispered me that I should follow him and make an offer of my services. To this I agreed; not knowing 
                      precisely what to make of so ridiculous a piece of business.</p>
                      <p>The duellist accepted my aid with his stiff and ultra recherche air, and, taking my arm, led me to his apartment.
                         I could hardly forbear laughing in his face while he proceeded to discuss, with the profoundest gravity, what he 
                         termed "the refinedly peculiar character" of the insult he had received. After a tiresome harangue in his ordinary 
                         style, he took down from his book shelves a number of musty volumes on the subject of the duello, and entertained me
                          for a long time with their contents; reading aloud, and commenting earnestly as he read. I can just remember the 
                          titles of some of the works. There were the "Ordonnance of Philip le Bel on Single Combat"; the "Theatre of Honor,"
                           by Favyn, and a treatise "On the Permission of Duels," by Andiguier. He displayed, also, with much pomposity, 
                           Brantome's "Memoirs of Duels," published at Cologne, 1666, in the types of Elzevir a precious and unique 
                           vellum-paper volume, with a fine margin, and bound by Derome. But he requested my attention particularly, 
                           and with an air of mysterious sagacity, to a thick octavo, written in barbarous Latin by one Hedelin, a Frenchman,
                            and having the quaint title, "Duelli Lex Scripta, et non; aliterque." From this he read me one of the drollest 
                            chapters in the world concerning "Injuriae per applicationem, per constructionem, et per se," about half of which, 
                            he averred, was strictly applicable to his own "refinedly peculiar" case, although not one syllable of the whole
                            matter could I understand for the life of me. Having finished the chapter, he closed the book, and demanded what 
                            I thought necessary to be done. I replied that I had entire confidence in his superior delicacy of feeling, and 
                            would abide by what he proposed. With this answer he seemed flattered, and sat down to write a note to the Baron. 
                            It ran thus:</p><p>Sir, My friend, M. P.-, will hand you this note. I find it incumbent upon me to request, 
                              at your earliest convenience, an explanation of this evening's occurrences at your chambers. In the event of your 
                              declining this request, Mr. P. will be happy to arrange, with any friend whom you may appoint, the steps 
                              preliminary to a meeting.</p><p>With sentiments of perfect respect,</p><p>Your most humble servant,</p>
                    <p>JOHANN HERMAN.</p><p>To the Baron Ritzner von Jung,</p><p>Not knowing what better to do, I called upon Ritzner 
                      with this epistle. He bowed as I presented it; then, with a grave countenance, motioned me to a seat. Having 
                      perused the cartel, he wrote the following reply, which I carried to Hermann.</p><p>SIR, Through our common friend,
                         Mr. P., I have received your note of this evening. Upon due reflection I frankly admit the propriety of the 
                         explanation you suggest. This being admitted, I still find great difficulty, (owing to the refinedly peculiar
                          nature of our disagreement, and of the personal affront offered on my part,) in so wording what I have to say by 
                          way of apology, as to meet all the minute exigencies, and all the variable shadows, of the case. I have great 
                          reliance, however, on that extreme delicacy of discrimination, in matters appertaining to the rules of etiquette, 
                          for which you have been so long and so pre-eminently distinguished. With perfect certainty, therefore, of being 
                          comprehended, I beg leave, in lieu of offering any sentiments of my own, to refer you to the opinions of Sieur 
                          Hedelin, as set forth in the ninth paragraph of the chapter of "Injuriae per applicationem, per constructionem, 
                          et per se," in his "Duelli Lex scripta, et non; aliterque." The nicety of your discernment in all the matters
                           here treated, will be sufficient, I am assured, to convince you that the mere circumstance of me referring you 
                           to this admirable passage, ought to satisfy your request, as a man of honor, for explanation.</p>
                           <p>With sentiments of profound respect,<br/> Your most obedient servant,<br/> VON JUNG.</p>
                           <p>The Herr Johann Hermann</p><p>Hermann commenced the perusal of this epistle with a scowl, 
                             which, however, was converted into a smile of the most ludicrous self-complacency as he came 
                             to the rigmarole about Injuriae per applicationem, per constructionem, et per se. Having finished 
                             reading, he begged me, with the blandest of all possible smiles, to be seated, while he made 
                             reference to the treatise in question. Turning to the passage specified, he read it with great 
                             care to himself, then closed the book, and desired me, in my character of confidential acquaintance, 
                             to express to the Baron von Jung his exalted sense of his chivalrous behavior, and, in that of second, 
                             to assure him that the explanation offered was of the fullest, the most honorable, and the most 
                             unequivocally satisfactory nature.</p><p>Somewhat amazed at all this, I made my retreat to the Baron.
                                He seemed to receive Hermann's amicable letter as a matter of course, and after a few words of 
                                general conversation, went to an inner room and brought out the everlasting treatise "Duelli Lex 
                                scripta, et non; aliterque." He handed me the volume and asked me to look over some portion of it.
                                 I did so, but to little purpose, not being able to gather the least particle of meaning. 
                                 He then took the book himself, and read me a chapter aloud. To my surprise, what he read proved to
                                  be a most horribly absurd account of a duel between two baboons. He now explained the mystery;
                                  showing that the volume, as it appeared prima facie, was written upon the plan of the nonsense 
                                  verses of Du Bartas; that is to say, the language was ingeniously framed so as to present to the
                                   ear all the outward signs of intelligibility, and even of profundity, while in fact not a shadow
                                    of meaning existed. The key to the whole was found in leaving out every second and third word 
                                    alternately, when there appeared a series of ludicrous quizzes upon a single combat as practised
                                     in modern times.</p><p>The Baron afterwards informed me that he had purposely thrown the 
                                       treatise in Hermann's way two or three weeks before the adventure, and that he was satisfied, 
                                       from the general tenor of his conversation, that he had studied it with the deepest attention, 
                                       and firmly believed it to be a work of unusual merit. Upon this hint he proceeded. Hermann would 
                                       have died a thousand deaths rather than acknowledge his inability to understand anything and 
                                       everything in the universe that had ever been written about the duello.</p><p>LITTLETON BARRY.</p>

        <p>Este cuento habla sobre un personaje el barón Ritzner Von Jung el cual decencia de una noble familia húngara.</p>
        <p>Hala de su época, que estudia en la Universidad, se dice que físicamente no era muy agraciado pero era una
           persona muy bromista y amigable.</p>
        <p>Durante su estancia de la universidad convirtió las habitaciones de sus compañeros en un autentico burdel,
           pues se comían y bebían cantidades exageradas. Precisamente por su forma de ser y forma de expresarse le 
           provoco un altercado con un compañero de la universidad al momento de una discusión sobre un duelo, algo 
            que se acostumbraba en esa época.</p>
